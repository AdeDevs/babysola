                  Maybe the next ring might just be an engagement ring, who

                  I don't remember much from this day but I remember you brought
                  food from a food chain restaurant, I didn't eat till after you
                  left sha <span>(very bad habit)</span>, you didn't cry this
                  day sha, you were more focused on trying not to get captured
                  for the same reason as always, even though you had taken
                  several other pictures with my phone earlier.

                  living alone at my brother's place, life was so beautiful at

                  games, talking otp, playing with Maia and Frodo, and the only
                  thing that made life better at that point was receiving videos
                  like this one, woke up to these in the morning after sleeping
                  late because I was playing FIFA and COD.{" "}

                  it that seriously, just wanted to try out my luck, and after
                  seeing you off after lesson at Excel and trying my luck that
                  day <span>(maybe i am lucky)</span>, you agreed and gave me
                  this strap, we swapped later though.
