                  Maybe the next ring might just be an engagement ring, who knows. This was from when you asked me to buy you a ring you saw and liked. <span>(Jewellery Lover)</span> It looks really nice on you though.

                  Can't even remember if it was day or night when I got these pictures but i remember we were on a video call and you were treating your hair or something, first time i saw someone take so much care of their hair, i think we talked about skincare too on the call <span>(nivea model/ambassador?)</span>.
